# Backdoors

The backdoors in this folder are used to generate the monitor scores. 

`o1_ref_o1mini_backdoor_more.json` are generated from my own backdoor pipeline on bigcodebench. `tyler_attack_policy_apps.json` are backdoors from the low stakes control paper generated on APPs

**Edit** Yeah seems plausibly bad to have this as plain text on the internet so I took it away. The backdoors here contain the question and solutions of these coding datasets.

Email me at the email found at [timhua.me](https://timhua.me/) if you want the raw backdoor data
